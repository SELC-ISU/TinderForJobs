## What is web development?
  - When I say web development, what does everyone imagine?  Some might think of programmers
    designing websites, however this is only the tip of the iceberg.  Web development is a lot
    more than just making a web page look nice; but rather a website is the culmination of
    *many* types of software.
  - Since everyone is familiar with it (even your grandmother), frontend development is the
    act of designing what the webpage actually *looks* like.
  - On the other side of the things, backend development is concerned with how the data that
    passes through the website is handled, the system hosting the website, and how the website handles
    different amounts of traffic.
        - It is largely technical compared to the frontend engineer.
        - A backend engineer might be concerned with client / server architecture, how data is
          put into a database, etc.
        - It is also important to realize that you need to specify how that website that you
          just designed is going to be accessed.  In this case, we use things called servers
          which is just a piece of code (and something to run it on) that acts as a “middle
          man” (often called middleware actually) to go from the computer that the website is
          being hosted on to what users see.
