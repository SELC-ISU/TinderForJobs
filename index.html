            <p> A document consists of elements.  Each element is started and
            ended with a pair of tags, like these. </p>
            <p> This is a paragraph element. Hello world! \n </p>

            <p> There are many different types of elements we can use to display
            information. </p>
            <ul>
                <li> This is a list item </li>
                <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"> This is another one, that's a link. </a> </li>
            </ul>
            <div class='wrapper'>
                <p> There are also these <span style="color: red"> cool</span> things called <strong> divs </strong> that are
                extremely useful.  They basically "wrap" other elements in a block.  We do this to group things together. </p>
            </div>
            <button id='cmp'> Click me, please. </button>
